===== General Remarks =====

	===== Threading =====
	1. threads which are executed using Tasks are background threads. as such, they are terminated when the program
	execution ends by throwing a ThreadAbortException.
	therefore there's no need to explicitly dispose of them on program termination.
	necessary cleanup can be performed in a catch clause.
